# Oluwadoyinsola Ore



Hi, i'm Oluwadoyinsola Ore a graduate of botany and a data analyst based in Lagos, Nigeria. 
From a young age, i've always enjoyed solving mathematical problems and puzzles which spiked my interest in data analytics. To me, big data sets are unprocessed gold that needs to be cleaned and properly analysed before one can get the best out of it and i someday hope to solve world problems and make the world a better place using data.
I am open to career opportunities (Internship / Entry level role) in a company where i can put my skills to good use and will give room for me to grow and learn.
